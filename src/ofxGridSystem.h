 ofxGridSystem
 
 ofxGridSystem lets you define a classic Swiss grid. If you position your objects based on the grid,
 using the methods shown below, you can adjust the grid and your objects will always conform.
 It also draws itself on screen. The grid has a lower left corner origin.
 
 Usage: Make your grid as a reference. i.e. ofxGridSystem grid; Add it with addChild(&grid);
 Then call grid.buildGrid(...) with parameters.
 
 To get 2nd column, 6 lines down from top, call grid[1][5], which returns an ofVec3 at that position.
 To get the X position of the 3rd column, call grid[3].x or grid.colX(3);
 To get the width of 3 columns (including gutters between them) call col(3);
